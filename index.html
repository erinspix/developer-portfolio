            <p>My name is Erin Spix. I graduated from the College for Creative Studies in 2018 with a degree in entertainment-focused art. During my time at CCS, I studied abroad in Italy for two semesters. Currently, I am studying programming through edX at Michigan State University. I serve as the resident millennial and art lead for a California-based startup. I possess a plethora of useless knowledge and have an extensive repertoire of SpongeBob and Vine references.</p>
